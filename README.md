# cdm-df - cdm with a doom fire animation
This project is a C rewrite of cdm adding functionalities to make it look and perform better.

## General info
Its written in C and uses the following libraries/headers:
* ncurses.h
* menu.h

## Installation
As of now you can install it by building the project with ``` make ``` and copying the executable over to a path that is also defined in youre PATH variable.
A few examples:

I will add an install and uninstall recipe to the makefile later.
